# Eatify

A scalable distributed backend for a food-ordering app.

QEats is a popular food ordering app that allows users to browse and order their favorite dishes from nearby restaurants. During the course of this Micro-Experience, developers build different parts of the QEats backend which is a Spring Boot application. Several REST API endpoints are implemented to query restaurant information and place food orders. To give a sense of real-world problems, production issues are introduced for the developer to investigate using Scientific Debugging methods. Along with this, the developer is expected to improve the app performance under large load scenarios as well as include an advanced search feature in the app.
